**Semester 2, 2024 Project @ Purdue University**

> During my Semester 2, 2024 exchange at Purdue University, I had the opportunity to join LaunchPad, a student-led mentorship program that pairs upperclassmen with incoming students to guide them through building a technical project. With no prior experience in full-stack development, I challenged myself to design and build a headache-tracking web application—born out of a real-life health challenge I was facing at the time. Just before my exchange, I was diagnosed with a benign osteoma (bone tumor) and advised by my doctor to track any unusual headaches and symptoms over the following six months. With the support of my mentor, I translated this need into a full-stack solution. This experience not only gave me practical exposure to full-stack development, but also taught me how to turn a personal challenge into a meaningful solution—something I’m incredibly proud of.
